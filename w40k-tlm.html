                <p class="project-description">
                    <strong>Warhammer 40,000: The Last Marine</strong> is a playable full-game developed over the course of four months as a university project 
                    between 39 developers at CITM, using our own custom engine <em>Coffee Engine</em>.<br><br>

                    As the <strong>Main Enemy Programmer</strong>, I was responsible for designing and implementing the entire enemy system — from the base 
                    architecture shared by all enemy types, to the full development of the Final Boss fight. I also led coordination within the enemy team, 
                    organizing tasks and supporting teammates throughout the development process.<br><br>

                    My contributions also extended to <strong>audio and VFX integration for enemies</strong>, as well as collaborating with other departments 
                    and assisting with final preparations for every release.<br><br>

                    This project has been one of the most rewarding and challenging experiences of my career so far. I'm incredibly proud of what our team accomplished 
                    — and I'm excited for the opportunities and challenges ahead.
